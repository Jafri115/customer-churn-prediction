# Customer Churn Prediction: End-to-End MLOps Project

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline for predicting customer churn, from data handling to model deployment and monitoring. It's split into two main parts:

1.  **Machine Learning Pipeline (`customer-churn-prediction` directory):** This part focuses on training and evaluating a model to predict customer churn.
2.  **Web Application (`churn-prediction-webapp` directory):** This is a simple web interface that allows users to input customer data and get a churn prediction using the deployed model.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to "churn" (stop using a service or cancel a subscription) based on their demographic information, account details, and service usage. This allows businesses (like telecom, SaaS, streaming services) to proactively identify at-risk customers and take retention actions.
